# Project Metadata

## 1. Data Summary
The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted estimate of the typical home value in U.S. dollars across different regions over time. The dataset includes regional metadata such as RegionID, RegionName, and State, followed by monthly ZHVI values spanning from January 2000 to August 2025 for each region, including the United States aggregate, and the corresponding metro area cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Miami). Data was accessed through the Zillow API and bulk CSV downloads, with a copy stored in the project repository under `DATA/Metro_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month.csv` in the DS4002 project folder. The dataset has a monthly temporal granularity and spatial granularity at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level, with additional coverage of national aggregates. All values are expressed in U.S. dollars.
